# ODC-Digit Recognizer 🔢

A web-based deep learning project that demonstrates handwritten digit recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), developed as part of the **AI and Data Science Scholarship** from **Orange Digital Center** in collaboration with **Amit Learning**.

👉 **Live App**: [Streamlit App](https://odc-digitrecognizer.streamlit.app/)  
📁 **GitHub Repository**: [ODC-Digit Recognizer](https://github.com/mohamedhosam4/ODC-Digit_Recognizer)

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project implements a **digit classification** model trained on the MNIST dataset. Users can draw digits on an interactive canvas, and the model predicts the drawn digit in real-time.

The application is deployed using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), offering a smooth user experience for testing the model.

## 🔧 Features

- ✍️ Draw a digit on a canvas and receive instant prediction.
- 🧠 **CNN-based model** trained on MNIST for high accuracy.
- 📦 Built with **TensorFlow / Keras** and deployed via **Streamlit**.
- 🌐 Clean and responsive user interface.
